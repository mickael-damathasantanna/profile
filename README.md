# My Bio

## When I started coding ?

I started coding in 2015.

## Why I started coding ?

I worked in an hospital and I wanted to create mobile app and digital tools to optimise patient and teams experience.

## How I started coding ?

First of all, I wanted to understand how mobile apps works, having an Iphone and a Mac, I started to learn Swift language. I use Youtube and LeSiteDuZero (Now, OpenClassRoom) where I found all the ressources to build strong knowledges.

## Today

I'm convinced that only results matter that why today I'm focus on languages that permit to offer fast and reliable solutions. Today,cross platform languages like React Native, frameworks like Expo,Electron, Flutter, Django, NodeJS offer performances very close to native languages. In the actual market, it is really important to be able to answer to short deadlines. I really like native languages and maybe tomorrow it will be THE solution with declarative native languages. I want to stay focus on client needs and user experience and don't forget that coding is just a tool to provide solutions.

## My principles

  - Client needs focus
  - User XP first
  - Don't code the same line two times
  - Branch before Refactor
  - Code Test Improve Test Commit 

## My Actual Languages

  - React
  - React Native
  - Javascript

## My Actual Frameworks

  - Expo
  - NodeJS
  - MongoDB 

## My Actual Cloud Services

  - AWS
  - Mongo Atlas

## Belief

I think Web 3.0 will be more useful, more pragmatic, less superfluous, "Life Hack" oriented at home like at work.

## Tomorrow

I'm actually learning SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose for mobile app because...FAST IS FUN ! 

## Why Hire Me ?

  - Team Spirit
  - User XP Oriented
  - Curious
  - "Don't stop when you're tired, stop when it's done"
  - A Giggle a day, like commit, put the doctor away
